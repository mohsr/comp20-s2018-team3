Week of 3/30 - 4/6

Accomplishments this Week:
	- Removed visible scroll wheel.

	- Added info windows to posters

	- Set up server and started working on API routes.
		- Added MongoDB integration.
		- Added GET / route to get homepage.
		- Added GET /events route to get events in JSON format from database.
		- Added POST /submit route to submit event information to the database.

Challenges Faced:
	- PDFs "wobble" when scrolled on, should be static.
	- Different browsers handle PDFs differently.
	- Posters cannot be scrolled through when mouse is on poster.

Goals for Next Week:
	- Adjust scrolling speed.
	- Add specific submission page.
	- Work further on server routes.
	- Work on admin page.
	- Work on POST /submit security.
