Accomplishments this Week:
	- Set up AWS S3 bucket for poster storage.
	- Set up server-side and client-side code to generate signed URL to upload 
	  images directly to AWS S3.
	- Set up feature to add random text to AWS S3 file URLs to guarantee 
	  uniqueness of each poster.
	- Finished submission form functionality to submit data to MongoDB 
	  database and store image URLs.
