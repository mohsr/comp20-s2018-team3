Week of 4/14 - 4/21

Accomplishments this Week:
	- Set up AWS S3 bucket for poster storage.
	- Set up server-side and client-side code to generate signed URL to upload 
	  images directly to AWS S3.
	- Set up feature to add random text to AWS S3 file URLs to guarantee 
	  uniqueness of each poster.
	- Added submission form modal to main page.
	- Finished submission form functionality to submit data to MongoDB 
	  database and store image URLs.
	- Submission form displays "thank you" message upon submission.

Challenges Faced:
	- Initially figuring out how to upload images to AWS S3.
	- Getting HTTP POST to work with the form data for even submission.

Goals for Next Week:
	- Address further server-side needs before working on admin page.
	- Finally begin working on admin page.
	- Dynamically fill login page with data from MongoDB and AWS S3.

# Comments by Ming
* Excellent work.    Submission form is a huge win.
* "Address further server-side needs before working on admin page." => yes, this is top priority.  Admin page would be nice to have given enough time.
