Project title:
====================
Tufts Events Billboard

Problem statement
====================
Posters for events at Tufts Campus usually reside in the stairs leading to the academic quad from Tisch Library. These posters are replaced every week and tens of posters go to waste with not enough impact and emphasis on the events, as not many people look/remember these events. We believe this information should be delivered from digitally, since the majority of Tufts students already seek information on the web to get about events they are interested about.


How do you solve the problem?
====================
We want to create a tufts.io domain, that will display all upcoming events in Tufts with their posters, as if they were stuck on a wall. The PDFs of these events will be "stuck onto" a digital wall rather than the physical wall between the Quad and Tisch, allowing students to access more information from the event, while saving on paper as we aim to reduce paper waste used for the advertising of these events. 


Features to be implemented 
====================
1. A digital brick wall, with posters of events "stuck" to it.
2. Information boxes about the events, link to relevant URL when the poster is clicked (Facebook event page, other website, etc.)
3. Event submission button, where an event can be submitted with all information provided. It will need to be verified by an admin before being posted on the website.
4. The admin panel to approve the events.


Data used and collected
====================
We could collect data on the number of clicks an event gets, providing feedback to the creators of the event on how successful their poster was, etc.

Algorithms and Special Techniques
====================
We won't be using any algorithms or special techniques in this project.
